    <p className='pagepara'>States, New Zealand, France as well as Germany is the hall-mark of ‘Study in Malaysia’ which has helped many local and international students studying in Malaysia save substantial cost in their pursuit for internationally recognised Bachelor’s degree programmes in the last 2 decades.
3 + 0′ Bachelor’s Degree from Foreign Leading Universities
Many Malaysian private institutions of higher learning have gained confidence and trust from universities in countries like the United Kingdom, Australia and United States to allow these local private educational institutions to offer complete foreign university degree programmes (from the partner universities) in Malaysia. The qualification from these programmes will be awarded by the partner universities. Therefore, these quality-assured foreign degree qualifications (3+0) can be acquired at much reduced education cost in Malaysia. A 3+0 programme is an extension of a twinning programme. The 3+0 programme allows students to complete the entire foreign degree programme right here in Malaysia, and still be conferred with a degree from the partner university overseas.</p>
          
          <p className='pagebold'>WHY STUDY IN MALAYSIA</p>
          <p className='pagepara'>There are some additional material benefits to pursuing a masters or PhD program in a Malaysian institution as well. The level of tuition fees international graduate students currently pay is a fraction of those at equivalent universities in Australia, the UK and the USA. Ranging between US$3,000 and US$7,000, depending on the institution and the program of study, Malaysian graduate degrees represent great value for money , an issue further highlighted when one factors in the reduced cost of living in the country.
ForeignUniversity Branch Campuses in Malaysia</p>
          <p className='pagepara'>Since 1998, 5 international reputable universities have set up their branch campuses in Malaysia and offered their own courses to students (both local and international) in order that these students can acquire identical university qualifications at a lower education cost in Malaysia. For example, the tuition fee of a 3-year UK Engineering Degree is priced at about USD24,500.</p>
          <p className='pagebold'>LIVING COST IN MALAYSIA </p>
          <p className='pagebold'>Low Living Cost</p>
          <p className='pagepara'>The cost of living for international students to study in Malaysia could be as low as RM10,000 which is approximately US$2,632 per annum (the cost of living in the city is about 10% higher). As such, the low living cost besides the cheaper tuition fee would appeal to both international and local students in terms of great savings of living expenses while studying in Malaysia

           <p className='pagepara'>The average Malaysian spends around 150 euros every month on food. Eating out is very affordable although there are also high-class restaurants which are rather expensive. Curry, noodles, stew and dried fish are just some of the common delicacies eaten by the average family in Malaysia. These meals could cost only around 2 euros but if homemade and ingredients are bought from local markets, overall price could go down to less than one Euro per dish depending on the meat or fish. Tea and milk are common beverages and are also very affordable
