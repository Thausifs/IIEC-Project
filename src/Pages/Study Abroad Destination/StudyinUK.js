<h1 className='studyinUKmainhead'>INTRODUCTION TO BRITISH EDUCATION SYSTEM</h1>
<p className='studyinUKparas'>The education system in the UK is different to that in many other countries. At the age of 16, British children take General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations. Students then transfer to studying A-Levels which last for two years and qualify them for entry to university. Students tend to specialize in these courses and often study for three or four A-Levels. This means that degrees do not last as long in the UK as other countries.</p>

<h2 className='studyinUKheadings'>
Apply for Undergraduate Study</h2>

<p className='studyinUKparas'>If you left school with qualifications other than A-Levels or the International Baccalaureate, you may need to take a Foundation course. A Foundation year gives you important focused skills that UK students receive during their A-Levels and often includes English Language tuition. An undergraduate degree normally takes three years to complete but can take longer if they include an industrial placement, an additional subject or a year abroad. They are also specialized from Year One.

</li><br/>
    <li className='studyinUKparali'>Undergraduate Masters degree (e.g. M. Eng) – an enhanced four year undergraduate degree including extra subjects studied at a deeper level</li>
</ul>

GENERAL ENTRY REQUIREMENTS FOR POSTGRADUATE STUDY
</h1>
<h2 className='studyinUKheadings'>
English language requirements
</h2>
<p className='studyinUKparas'>

    <li className='studyinUKparali'>If you do not have the appropriate subject background for direct entry to first year, or you have not studied the appropriate subjects to the required depth, (which may be the case if you have followed a 12-year education system), you might be eligible to undertake a foundation year course to bring you up to the right level for first year entry.
