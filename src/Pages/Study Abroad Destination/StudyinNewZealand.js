           <p className='studyinnewzealandpara'>New Zealand is an archipelago made up of over 700 islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Most people live on the two largest islands, the North and South Islands, which together are similar in size to Japan or the United Kingdom. Located on the Pacific Rim of Fire, New Zealand has a spectacular and fertile landscape sprinkled with volcanoes, geothermal parks and hot springs. Culturally diverse and easy going, New Zealanders (Kiwis) are renowned for being independent and innovative. The majority of the populations are European with indigenous Maori comprising around 15 percent. Aspects of the Maori culture, language and heritage weave through all parts of our cultural and social landscape. You’ll find centers of worship for most religions. We celebrate Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, and have festivals for many other cultures and religions throughout the year. The official languages in New Zealand are English, Maori and Sign Language.

<h2 className='studyinnewzealandheadings'>GUIDE FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
</h2>
<h2 className='studyinnewzealandheadings'>Foreign student fees
</h2>       
<p className='studyinnewzealandparas'>Most international students must pay foreign student fees at New Zealand educational institutes. However, some international students are exempt from paying foreign student fees, because they are classed as domestic students for fee paying purposes.
</p>
<h2 className='studyinnewzealandheadings'>Pastoral Care of International Students
</h2>
<p className='studyinnewzealandpara'>The Ministry of Education operates a Code of Practice that provides a framework for looking after international students. It covers pastoral care, accommodation and provision of information.
</p>
<h2 className='studyinnewzealandheadings'>
Guide to living and studying in New Zealand for international students
</h2>
<p className='studyinnewzealandparas'>A new guide has been produced by the Ministry of Education and it’s full of useful and interesting information for international students. There’s advice on how to prepare before you leave home, arriving in New Zealand, living, working and studying here. Some of the information is focused for Chinese students, but a lot of it is useful no matter what country you’re from.
</p>
 <h2 className='studyinnewzealandheading'>Quality Assurance of Tertiary Education
</h2>       
<p className='studyinnewzealandparas'>Quality assurance of tertiary education in New Zealand focuses on the quality of learning outcomes recognised through qualifications as a whole, and also on the systems and processes that support quality delivery by providers.
</p>
  <p className='studyinnewzealandparas'>Only those tertiary qualifications and providers that are quality assured by a quality approval body are eligible for Government financial assistance. Quality assurance bodies decide whether providers and qualification developers meet appropriate standards.</p>       
   <p className='studyinnewzealandparas'>NZQA registers private education providers and recommends the approval of government training establishments to the Minister of Education. It accredits and audits educational institutions and other registered learning establishments that offer approved courses and award credit for registered qualifications. It also accredits industry training organisations to register workplace assessors. All registered education providers and approved courses and qualifications outside the universities are listed on NZQA’s website.
</p>     
<p className='studyinnewzealandparas'>In addition to the functions and activities of the Ministry of Education quality assurance is provided through the following means.
</p>
<h2 className='studyinnewzealandheading'>Quality Assurance for the Pastoral Care of International Students
</h2>
<p className='studyinnewzealandparas'>The Ministry of Education operates a Code of Practice for the Pastoral Care of International Students. The Code (introduced in October 2002) provides a framework for delivery of pastoral care, accommodation and provision of information by education providers and their agents to international students. It sets out minimum standards of advice and care that are expected of education providers. All education providers that enrol international students must be signatories to the Code.
</p>
<p className='studyinnewzealandparas'>
Providers are required to have fair and equitable internal procedures for resolving student grievances. If concerns are not resolved by using these internal procedures, students can contact the International Education Appeal Authority. This Authority investigates complaints, determines if there has been a breach of the Code, and sets out remedies when a breach has occurred. The Code can be viewed on the Ministry’s website. NZQA has delegated authority for the approval and accreditation of polytechnics and institute of technology courses below degree level to the Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics of New Zealand (formerly the Association of Polytechnics in NZ) and its Polytechnic Programmes Committee. Similarly, NZQA has delegated authority for the approval and accreditation of colleges of education courses below degree level to the Association of Colleges of Education in New Zealand (ACENZ) and its Colleges of Education Accreditation Committee (CEAC).
</p>
<p className='studyinnewzealandparas'>
The New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee (NZVCC) provides quality assurance for university qualifications through the Committee on University Academic Programmes (CUAP). This Committee oversees inter-university course approval and moderation procedures, provides advice and comment on academic developments, encourages the coherent and balanced development of curricula, and facilitates cross-crediting between qualifications.
</p>
<p className='studyinnewzealandparas'>The New Zealand Universities Academic Audit Unit (NZUAAU) established by NZVCC, carries out university academic quality audits, drawing on both New Zealand and international experts.</p>
<p className='studyinnewzealandparas'>NZVCC and NZQA use common criteria for the approval and accreditation of degrees.</p>
