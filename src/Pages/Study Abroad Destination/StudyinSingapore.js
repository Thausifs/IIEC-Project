<h1 className='studyinsingaporemainhead'>GUIDE FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDIES</h1>
<h2 className='studyinsingaporeheadings'>Country overview
</h2>
<div>
    <p className='studyinsingaporeparas'>Singapore stands out for its magnificent blend and influences of Chinese, Malay and Indian traditions. It is this, combined with up-to-the-minute technology and unparalleled cleanliness, that gives the city its character. It is also a major hub for travellers, and as an international student, you will be able to benefit from excellent travel deals to nearby Malaysia, Indonesia and even Australia.</p>
    <p className='studyinsingaporeparas'>Religious monuments and buildings fill the streets in Chinatown and Kampong Glam, whilst you’ll be spoilt for choice to choose between the continuous festivals and events that take place throughout the year. The international cuisine of Singapore really is something to behold and explore, with a variety of dishes you are sure to have never tried, or possibly will never want to try again!
</p>
    <p className='studyinsingaporeparas'>Should you want some respite from the city, greenery and rainforest await you not too far away. Alternatively, you can opt to relax in one of the nation’s numerous and luxurious spas.
</p>
    <p className='studyinsingaporeparas'>
Three publicly funded universities exist in Singapore. The National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University. Singapore also has five polytechnics, offering two and three year diplomas, in many different subject areas.
</p>
    <p className='studyinsingaporeparas'>Additionally, Singapore plays host to both an increasingly diverse private education scene and a growing number of offshore campuses. A number of these private institutions offer qualifications with completely international curricula such as those for the Chartered Institute of Marketing and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants. Moreover, others offer international undergraduate programs from universities in countries such as Australia, Finland, New Zealand, the UK and the USA.
</p>
    <p className='studyinsingaporeparas'>All national and international students are free to apply to the Singaporean Ministry of Education for a Tuition Grant once they have been admitted to their program of choice. This scheme allows for a grant of between SIN$14,000 and SIN$16,000 for most programs to be paid against tuition fees, thus reducing the amount considerably. For programs such as medicine and music, the grant can be as much as SIN$65,500 a year. However, international students are required to sign a bond in order to obtain a tuition grant, committing them to work in Singapore for three years after the completion of their university of polytechnic program.
