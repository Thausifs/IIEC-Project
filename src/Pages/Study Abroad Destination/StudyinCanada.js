<h1 className='studyincanadamainhead'>TYPE OF EDUCATION</h1>
<p className='studyincanadaparas'>Canadian education system encompass both publicly funded and private schools, from kindergarten through to an university. Education is a provincial responsibility under the Canadian constitution, which means there are significant differences between the education systems of the different provinces. However, standards across the country are uniformly high.</p>
<h2 className='studyincanadaheadings'>Universities:</h2>
<p className='studyincanadaparas'>Canada has a large selection of universities and colleges located in both urban and rural settings in every region of the country. Its universities are internationally known for the quality of teaching and research. Degrees from Canadian universities are considered equivalent to those from American and other Commonwealth universities. Canadian universities are largely publicly funded; as a result, they are of a consistently high quality, regardless of location or area of study. Also, they all retain a high degree of academic autonomy. Full-time student enrollments at individual universities range from less than 1,000 students to over 35,000 in the major universities. In addition, most universities have a large number of part-time or continuing education students. They offer a broad range of courses and a full range of degrees from undergraduate to doctorates and can offer certificates and professional degrees. Fees for universities differ depending on the province, institution and program of study.</p>
<h2 className='studyincanadaheadings'>Education Cost:</h2>
<p className='studyincanadaparas'>For those looking to study in Korea, the cost of the degree is an important factor to consider. The fees vary depending on the university and the degree opted, but there is a pattern that is observed across major universities. For instance, at Kyungdong University, the fee structure is as listed below: TUITION FEES Programs Taught in Korean USD $2,500 (for 6 months) USD $5,000 (for 1 year) UG Programs USD $5,000 (per semester) * The above fees are subject to change at any time. * Each course uses a textbook, which will be an additional cost to each student. Tuition fees aren’t the only major expenditure when it comes to studying in Korea; one has to consider miscellaneous expenses, such as lodging and food. As an example, here’s a breakdown of how it works: Housing Fee: The housing fee comes to USD $800 a year, for 6 months. Food: The housing does not include daily meals, so you have to make your own arrangements when it comes to food. Some institutes may offer a mess facility, though. Transport: Depending on where your housing is, you have to make arrangements for your daily commute to and from your institute. *Kindly note that all foreign students will have to purchase health insurance worth USD $200, which is valid for a year.

They also meet the educational needs of vocationally oriented secondary school graduates, employment-seeking university graduates, as well as the lifelong learning requirements of the adult population. Historically, these institutions offer diplomas, as community needs change and evolve and at least 18 are now granting degrees and applied degrees. The two- to three-year (or shorter) college programs typically offer specific, vocationally-oriented curricula, as well as general academic concentrations.
