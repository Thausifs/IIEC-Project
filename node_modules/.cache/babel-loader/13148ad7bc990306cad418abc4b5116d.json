The level of tuition fees international graduate students currently pay is a fraction of those at equivalent universities in Australia, the UK and the USA. Ranging between US$3,000 and US$7,000, depending on the institution and the program of study, Malaysian graduate degrees represent great value for money , an issue further highlighted when one factors in the reduced cost of living in the country.\r\nForeignUniversity Branch Campuses in Malaysia</p>\r\n          <p className='studyinmalaysiapara'>Since 1998, 5 international reputable universities have set up their branch campuses in Malaysia and offered their own courses to students (both local and international) in order that these students can acquire identical university qualifications at a lower education cost in Malaysia. For example, the tuition fee of a 3-year UK Engineering Degree is priced at about USD24,500.</p>\r\n          <h1 className='studyinmalaysiamainhead'>LIVING COST IN MALAYSIA </h1>\r\n          <h2 className='studyinmalaysiaheading'>Low Living Cost</h2>\r\n          <p className='studyinmalaysiapara'>The cost of living for international students to study in Malaysia could be as low as RM10,000 which is approximately US$2,632 per annum (the cost of living in the city is about 10% higher). As such, the low living cost besides the cheaper tuition fee would appeal to both international and local students in terms of great savings of living expenses while studying in Malaysia\r\n</p>\r\n           <p className='studyinmalaysiapara'>The average Malaysian spends around 150 euros every month on food. Eating out is very affordable although there are also high-class restaurants which are rather expensive. Curry, noodles, stew and dried fish are just some of the common delicacies eaten by the average family in Malaysia. These meals could cost only around 2 euros but if homemade and ingredients are bought from local markets, overall price could go down to less than one Euro per dish depending on the meat or fish. Tea and milk are common beverages and are also very affordable\r\n</p>\r\n   <h2 className='studyinmalaysiaheading'>\r\nQuality of Education\r\n</h2>\r\n\r\n<p className='studyinmalaysiapara'>\r\nBeing recognised as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, one of the success factors is the ability of the higher educational institutions to provide professional, career-focused education. The institutions here work closely with leading companies, industry professionals and foreign partner universities to ensure that the courses offered are up-to-date and market relevant so as to enhance the employability of their graduates.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2 className='studyinmalaysiaheading'>Politically Sound and Geographically Safe Country\r\n</h2>\r\n<p className='studyinmalaysiapara'>Malaysia is a politically and socially secure country that is governed by a stable government with safety measures incorporated in the laws of the country. It is also free from racial and religious mishaps. The tropical climate is warm and humid throughout the year without any drastic weather changes. Malaysia is also geographically safe from major natural disasters as it is located in a natural catastrophe-free zone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p className='studyinmalaysiapara'>As such, from the political, geographical, social and economical point, Malaysia is a very suitable place for students, especially international students to study and live in.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       <YourNextStep></YourNextStep>\r\n           <Footer></Footer>\r\n              </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default StudyinMalaysia  ;  \r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
