Degrees from Canadian universities are considered equivalent to those from American and other Commonwealth universities. Canadian universities are largely publicly funded; as a result, they are of a consistently high quality, regardless of location or area of study. Also, they all retain a high degree of academic autonomy. Full-time student enrollments at individual universities range from less than 1,000 students to over 35,000 in the major universities. In addition, most universities have a large number of part-time or continuing education students. They offer a broad range of courses and a full range of degrees from undergraduate to doctorates and can offer certificates and professional degrees. Fees for universities differ depending on the province, institution and program of study.</p>\r\n<h2>Education Cost:</h2>\r\n<p>For those looking to study in Korea, the cost of the degree is an important factor to consider. The fees vary depending on the university and the degree opted, but there is a pattern that is observed across major universities. For instance, at Kyungdong University, the fee structure is as listed below: TUITION FEES Programs Taught in Korean USD $2,500 (for 6 months) USD $5,000 (for 1 year) UG Programs USD $5,000 (per semester) * The above fees are subject to change at any time. * Each course uses a textbook, which will be an additional cost to each student. Tuition fees aren’t the only major expenditure when it comes to studying in Korea; one has to consider miscellaneous expenses, such as lodging and food. As an example, here’s a breakdown of how it works: Housing Fee: The housing fee comes to USD $800 a year, for 6 months. Food: The housing does not include daily meals, so you have to make your own arrangements when it comes to food. Some institutes may offer a mess facility, though. Transport: Depending on where your housing is, you have to make arrangements for your daily commute to and from your institute. *Kindly note that all foreign students will have to purchase health insurance worth USD $200, which is valid for a year. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Universities Colleges:\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>Canadian university colleges offer a strong base of applied and academic programs in campus environments. As the name suggests, a university college offers university degrees as well as college diploma and certificate programs. Students can expect to find a wide range of program choices at university colleges, including English as a Second Language (ESL) programs. As a component of the Canadian university system, university colleges offer students a choice of either academically oriented university degree programs or the more practically oriented college diplomas and certificates. As part of the Canadian college system, university colleges are distinguished by their strong student support services, small classes and strong campus environments. They also may offer combined degree/diploma programs and university transfer programs.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Community Colleges:\r\n</h2>\r\n <p>\r\nThe 175 post-secondary institutions which are members of the Association of Canadian Community Colleges (ACCC) are officially known by a range of titles, including Community College, Technical Institute, University College and Cégep. All of these institutions have the primary function of responding to the training needs of business, industry and the public service sectors. They also meet the educational needs of vocationally oriented secondary school graduates, employment-seeking university graduates, as well as the lifelong learning requirements of the adult population. Historically, these institutions offer diplomas, as community needs change and evolve and at least 18 are now granting degrees and applied degrees. The two- to three-year (or shorter) college programs typically offer specific, vocationally-oriented curricula, as well as general academic concentrations.\r\n</p>       \r\n<h2>\r\nCareer Colleges:\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>A technical/career college is a privately owned and operated school with the main objective of preparing students for the job market after a short period of instruction. The emphasis at technical/career colleges is on practical skills over a broad range of programs. They may specialize in specific areas such as business, computers and secretarial skills. Although privately owned, these schools are provincially approved and regulated, ensuring that program standards and quality are maintained. Career colleges have highly competitive fee structures.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<YourNextStep></YourNextStep>\r\n           <Footer></Footer>\r\n              </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default StudyinCanada  ;  "]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
