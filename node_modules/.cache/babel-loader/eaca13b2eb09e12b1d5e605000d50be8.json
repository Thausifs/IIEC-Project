Your choice may depend on your level of education, personality, study style and financial situation.</p>\r\n            <p>The accommodation options for international students are:</p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li>On-campus residences\r\n</li>\r\n                <li>School boarding houses\r\n</li>\r\n                <li>Homestay\r\n</li>\r\n                <li>Rented accommodation.\r\n</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n            <p>When you first arrive, you may stay in a hostel or guest house while you are working out your accommodation. Institutions often have links with local hostels which may provide discounts to students. Hostels and guest houses are about $80 to $135 a week and hotels are $50 to $100 a night.</p>\r\n            <h2>On-campus residences or colleges</h2>\r\n            <p>These are offered at universities and some vocational institutions.

To rent out an entire apartment or house can cost from $100 to $600 depending on the size and location.</p>\r\n          <h2>EDUCATION SYSTEM</h2>\r\n          <p>The Australian education system is broadly divided into the university, vocational, school and English language sectors.</p>\r\n          <p>\r\nUniversity is the highest level of study in Australia.
