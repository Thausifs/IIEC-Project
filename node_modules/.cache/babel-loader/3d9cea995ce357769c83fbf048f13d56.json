frequently asked questions!</p>\r\n           <hr></hr>\r\n           <p className='studyingabroadpara'>Your being on this page means you are tossing up your options to study abroad. That’s great! We understand this is a big step and you would want to satisfy all your queries before you take the plunge. So, don’t worry, our international education specialists have collated a list of questions that students like you raise when considering moving abroad for further studies. Hope these help!</p>\r\n            <h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>Preparing to study abroad</h2>\r\n            <h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>Am I eligible to study abroad?</h2>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadpara'> To begin studying as an international student, there are a range of entry requirements you may have to meet.</p>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadpara'>The academic requirements (including evidence of English language skills) you need to study abroad will vary depending on the level of education you want to pursue. For instance, some courses will require you to have done a foundation course before applying for a degree. All universities and schools can have different entry requirements, so read the course information on their respective websites very carefully.</p>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadpara'>Your IDP counsellor will help you assess your eligibility for different programs and guide you on the courses and locations that best meet your preferences.</p>\r\n            <h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>How much will it cost to study abroad?</h2>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadpara'>The costs associated with studying at a university or school abroad vary greatly. It depends on the nature of your chosen program, the length of your stay, the distance you travel and the kind of lifestyle you want when you get there.</p>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadpara'>Be aware that some student visas require you to have a certain amount of funds available in your bank account when you arrive in your chosen country. It is best to review the immigration websites for the country you wish to study in or speak to one of our counsellors.</p>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadpara'>Many students choose to carry out some part-time work alongside their studies to support their living or socialising costs. However, there are restrictions on the hours you are allowed to work to ensure you don’t lose your academic focus. Learn more about the cost of studying abroad here.</p>\r\n            <h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>When should I start planning my study abroad procedure? </h2>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadpara'>We recommend you to start as early as possible. This will give you enough time to ponder upon your interests and research according to your personal and academic goals and aspirations. Location, course duration, costs, accommodation, and living conditions are some of the other aspects that you need to figure out along with your program. Start planning at least one year or intake in advance. Of course, we are here to help you throughout the entire process.</p>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadpara'>To make it easier to plan, we mapped an indicative timeline for you to get started and live your study abroad dreams.</p>\r\n            <h2 className='studyingabroadheadings'>How long does the application process take?</h2>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadparas'>We recommend you begin your application process at least a year in advance to give enough time for your applications to be processed and to prepare for your time overseas. Remember, the academic year begins at different times of the year in different countries. </p>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadparas'>Know more about upcoming intakes.</p>\r\n            <h2 className='studyingabroadheadings'>What if my parents don’t want me to go overseas? </h2>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadparas'>It’s natural for your family to be nervous about letting their child travel alone to a new country. Millions of students have done so and thrived, but this doesn’t make it less difficult for parents to accept.</p>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadparas'>We encourage you to involve your parents in any discussions or appointments you have with IDP. With the reassurance of an international education specialist like IDP, your parents would feel more confident seeing you being assisted by a professional and responsible organisation in your applications and preparations.</p>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadparas'>Refer to our guide for parents to help put your family’s concerns at rest.</p>\r\n            <h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>What if I can’t afford to study overseas?</h2>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadpara'>There are various scholarships and bursaries available for international students to help them fund their studies. The amount and availability varies by the level of study and institution. Since scholarships are competitive in nature, you will have to demonstrate exceptional academic achievements to earn them. Governments and other organisations also provide scholarships and awards to help international students fund their studies. Speak with your IDP counsellor for details of various scholarships available for your chosen course and university.</p>\r\n            <p className='studyingabroadpara'>Explore various scholarships available for Indian students in different destinations here. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>Working during and after studying abroad </h2>\r\n<h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>Can I work and study at the same time?\r\n</h2>\r\n<p className='studyingabroadpara'>Working while you study can complement your educational and living experience when studying abroad. If you pursue a course at a degree level or above you may be permitted to work while on an international student visa. But before you undertake any paid work, make sure that your visa permits it. The opportunity for students to work part-time during their studies varies from country to country.\r\n</p>\r\n<p className='studyingabroadpara'>Many universities have a dedicated job centre on campus for students that advertises job opportunities and internships to help students develop various skills. The university careers service is also a useful source of information.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>Will my overseas qualification be accepted in my home country?\r\n</h2>\r\n<p className='studyingabroadpara'>The skills and qualifications employers and professional registration bodies require will vary from country to country. If, for example, you are working towards a career with strict entry requirements such as medicine, engineering, accounting or teaching, conduct some research with the relevant registration bodies in India for advice.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>Will studying abroad help me find a good job?</h2>\r\n<p className='studyingabroadpara'>Your career prospects will benefit hugely from your experience of studying, living and socialising abroad. It’s your opportunity to develop a wealth of new skills, perspectives and stronger English language skills and seek work experience from the kind of employers you’d like to work for.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p className='studyingabroadpara'>A recent study conducted with more than 4,500 ex-international students explored the exact skills employers in the US value when it comes to recruiting people that have studied overseas.</p>\r\n <h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>Using an agent to study abroad\r\n</h2>\r\n<h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>Do I need an education agent?\r\n</h2>\r\n<p className='studyingabroadpara'>While you can apply to study directly to an institution, you may choose to use the expertise of an international education specialist (also known as a student counsellor) to guide you through the process of choosing the right university or college and enrolling thereafter. Using an accredited and trusted agent, like IDP, can help reduce the stress of choosing an institution in another country, applying and preparing to leave. </p>\r\n<p className='studyingabroadpara'>Our student counsellors are knowledgeable and up-to-date on curriculum changes, and have your best interests at heart. Most of them have been international students themselves and can thus offer first hand advice every step of the way.</p>\r\n<h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>Does idp cost money to see a counsellor at IDP?</h2>\r\n<p className='studyingabroadpara'>Our services are free for students. You do not have to pay anything to book an appointment with IDP. However, there may be some small fees for courier services or document verification. For more information, call up your nearest IDP office.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2 className='studyingabroadheading'>What ongoing support does IDP give?\r\n</h2>\r\n<p className='studyingabroadpara'>Our service extends beyond study advice and applications. We organise pre-departure orientations that cover topics such as student life in your new country, advice on adapting to new culture and how to deal with homesickness besides managing money and developing soft skills.</p>\r\n<p className='studyingabroadpara'>We also host welcome activities when you arrive in your new city where you’ll meet fellow and former international students from around the world.</p>\r\n<p className='studyingabroadpara'>If you are moving to Australia, we can help you get all the essential services you’ll need while living abroad — health insurance, foreign exchange, accommodation, setting up a bank account and obtaining a SIM card.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<YourNextStep></YourNextStep>\r\n<Footer></Footer>\r\n         </div>\r\n\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default StudyingAbroadFAQs ;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
